# Hello-World
First project on GitHub

I am completely new to GitHub, but I have been going to school for Computer Engineering.
The whole reason why I created this account was because of the Lg FX0 phone from au,
but I know nothing about android. I know some java and c++ coding,
and while I was doing research on how to put a custom ROM on the phone,
I figured I would try to make one myself. I hope to learn some code,
and I hope to put together a ROM that works for the phone.
